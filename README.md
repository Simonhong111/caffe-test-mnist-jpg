# caffe-test-mnist-jpg

test trained mnist digit recognition with jpg input

After training the digit recognition mnist project, you might want to test it on your data.
Here is a python code that loads the trained caffemodel. 
Then a jpg image is loaded into the input blobs and the ouput digit is computed.

Three sample images are provided for test. 
You can create your own handwritten digits, resize them to 28*28 and
then try to recognize them using the network.
